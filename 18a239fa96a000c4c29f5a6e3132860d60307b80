Would it be better to add a loop where you check that the threads are gone for X number of seconds and fail if it doesn\u0027t happen. This would allow the test to finish earlier than 1 second if you do the check more than once  second.\n\nAnd should the timeout be affected by the hw timeout multiplier?",
