Would it be better to add a loop where you check that the threads are gone for X number of seconds and fail if it doesn\u0027t happen. This would allow the test to finish earlier than 1 second if you do the check more than once second.\n\n...but i think i like this idea better anyway? just loop until the thread count is 1, and let the failure be a timeout.\n\nthe only downside to that is that you don\u0027t get to see _what_ the thread count is. but since it should realistically only be 0 or 1, that doesn\u0027t seem like much of a loss. and we already had a comment explaining why this isn\u0027t just ASSERT_EQ(), so there\u0027s no difference there either.\n\ndone!",
