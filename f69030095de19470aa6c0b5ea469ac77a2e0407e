      "message": "This is unrelated. The discussion in internal CL is about making __BIONIC_WEAK_FOR_NATIVE_BRIDGE less offensive for native build. But the mechanism itself will stay, we need it in the emulated build anyway, to overwrite things that should be shared with native libc.\n\nWhile we share pthread_internal_t between emulated and native, we need to overwrite access to pthread_internal_t::stack_top to return emulated value instead of native value - so we need to move the access to a __BIONIC_WEAK_FOR_NATIVE_BRIDGE function.",

      "message": "now I see your point, thanks! waiting for Peter\u0027s opinion.\n\nyes, this change might slow things down. though, as the change is in the code that is executed only once, I hope the penalty is neglectable, especially as there is a sigaltstack call as well.\n\noverall, most __BIONIC_WEAK_FOR_NATIVE_BRIDGE annotations now apply to exported functions, so likely not inlined anyway. the exceptions are __clone_for_fork, pair of functions in init and maybe this one. still, improving the normal build looks like the right thing to do.",
