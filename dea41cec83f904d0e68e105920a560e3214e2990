It\u0027d only be useful if there were a big end-to-end test where a custom property info file is generated and it\u0027s tested.  But since we already have tests for property_info mappings, and this test as is tests the mappings currently present on a device, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to get anything out of adding that test.",
