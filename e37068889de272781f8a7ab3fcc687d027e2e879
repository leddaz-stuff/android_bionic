      "message": "that would be more expensive than just replacing it with `isalpha() || isdigit()`, so that would be the worst of all choices... but, yeah, maybe i should come back and just stop using `_ctype_`.\n\nto be clear: i\u0027m not against removing `_ctype_` and the `_CTYPE_*` macros from the header (even if the former has to stay in libc for another decade), if you want to have that fight with your users :-) (i was under the impression that libc++ still used this stuff directly, but a local hack to rip this out seems to build fine. so maybe no-one cares any more?)",
