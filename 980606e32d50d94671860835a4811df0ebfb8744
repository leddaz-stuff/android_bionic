You should create a rule for generating the file math_csv_test.cpp that does this instead.\n\nI think it would be something like:\n\nbionic/tests/math_csv_test.cpp:\n  $(LOCAL_PATH)/create_bionic_tests.py libcore/luni/src/test/resources/math_tests.csv $(GENERATED_LOCATION)/bionic/tests/math_csv_test.c\n\nI don\u0027t think this is exactly the rule you need, but it\u0027s close.\n\nThen change the src_files to contain the same name. You shouldn\u0027t generate the file into the source tree since that will confuse git.",
