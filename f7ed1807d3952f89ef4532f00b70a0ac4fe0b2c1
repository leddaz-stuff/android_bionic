      "message": "do not use ANDROID_CHANGES in headers that will be exposed through the NDK.\n\nA better macro is to use __ANDROID__, since it is defined by the Android toolchain automatically, not requiring explicitely setting it at compile time with -D\n\nThis applies to all the other headers in this patch set.",
