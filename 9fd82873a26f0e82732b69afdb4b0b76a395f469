      "message": "Hmm, I\u0027ve got this set of patches (aosp/1514989) that use the gwp-asan options parser instead, which is a lot more flexible and would allow us to do \"torture testing\" of bionic under GWP-ASan.\n\nThe question is, will I ever get back to landing them... I\u0027d like to avoid introducing a sysprop and then immediately changing the semantics/deprecating it.",
