That makes sense, but is there some other way to do this that doesn\u0027t add a second of run-time to the tests? I thought ptrace had a way of running a stopped process until it hit a system call.",

      "message": "On a second thought, sleep() is unnecessary here. \nI only had sleep() there because in a previous version of the test, I had the parent trace the child - it had to wait for the child to init.\nBut then I figured it was easier and less code to set up the test if I had the child ptrace the parent. The parent has already done initted here. so no need to sleep/wait for it.",
