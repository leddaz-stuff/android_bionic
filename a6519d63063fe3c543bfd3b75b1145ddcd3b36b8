      "message": "only that i\u0027ve never liked the ASCII art in this file, and bringing together calls from different sections -- sections which i\u0027ve also never really liked because they don\u0027t add any value -- meant that i had to reformat the lines anyway, because different sections are indented a different amount.\n\nif i could be bothered, i\u0027d probably move to a ()return_type style so we could |sort the file.\n\ni don\u0027t care much though. if you were to upload a change that aligns the entire file to the same column, i\u0027d +2 that too.",
