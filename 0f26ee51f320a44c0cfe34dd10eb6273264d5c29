We should probably also set relocation_index_ \u003d relocation_count_ \u003d 0; so that the iterator can no longer be used, like in 87 above.\n\n(Note: for well-behaved client code that always calls has_next() before calling next(), I don\u0027t think we can ever reach here now -- this case is checked in read_group_fields(), and error detected there will force has_next() to always-false, line 87.)",
