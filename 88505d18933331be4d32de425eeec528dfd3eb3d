      "message": "They are all copies and have been standardized for building inside bionic. This file was created off compiler-rt\u0027s memset since it seemed strange to have two non-identical functions in the same file (with two separate entry/ends).\n\nAt first glance, both these licenses look comparable to the bsd license. I can add the LICENSE.TXT from compiler-rt to this path so long as it doesn\u0027t have additional implications on other files (I don\u0027t think it does).",
