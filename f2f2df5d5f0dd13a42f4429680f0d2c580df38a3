      "message": "With this patch the users who likely actually matter will use it, i.e. posix_spawn and (with a separate patch) Java. I don\u0027t think we need to do more than that (e.g. persuade apps to use it).\n\nThe idea behind making it a public API is that apps have the option of using it if they need to (e.g. they use stack tagging in their internal testing builds and have a custom process launcher). But if you think this is too far-fetched we can make it a platform-private API for now.\n\nIt may be worth considering bringing this up on libc-coord, but I guess it wouldn\u0027t be necessary if we add it as a platform-private API. Maybe we can start with a private API and in parallel I will see if I can find some time to start a thread on libc-coord.",
