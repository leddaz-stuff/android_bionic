      "message": "IIRC the TODO was added because during code review you observed that the algorithm was not correct in the presence of duplicates and did not preserve ordering. The intent was to clarify that such behaviour is intentional, because it matches what the caller does already.\n\nSo the \"We should probably fix that too.\" part of the comment about ordering is incorrect; instead it should say \"That also doesn\u0027t matter because the framework performs an order-insensitive comparison as well.\" We could also remove the word \"TODO:\" and just leave the comment as clarifying intent.\n\nAs for this CL, in general I don\u0027t think this CL it\u0027s useful. There\u0027s not much point in performing an order-sensitive comparison here, because the code that calls this already performs an order-insensitive comparison.",
