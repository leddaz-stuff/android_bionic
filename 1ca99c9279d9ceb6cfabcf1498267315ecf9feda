      "message": "we can\u0027t export cflags as part of a cc_library, just includes?\n\nshould we instead link our fts into musl, and #include_next the bionic header in a musl header? that would be the most transparent option.\n\ni\u0027m wondering how many of these we\u0027ll end up with in the long run. and it always was a PITA with glibc that you couldn\u0027t __unused/__packed/etc --- i don\u0027t have much of an opinion on whether we should have the -include in the global musl cflags, but i do think we\u0027d probably be better off with a global musl-compat.h file (even if we only explicitly pull it in in those places where it\u0027s actually needed). (the counterargument to that being the education one --- we\u0027d probably still end up with people reinventing the wheel with these things because they don\u0027t realize they can just `-include` to make them go away.) (the counter-counterargument probably being \"doesn\u0027t help macOS\", though i\u0027m assuming that should be _less_ of a problem going forward, and if it matters we could always do similar there.)",
