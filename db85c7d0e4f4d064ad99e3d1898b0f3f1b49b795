      "message": "This doesn\u0027t work very well either, having the kernel headers like linux/in.h reference the sockaddr_storage that is now in sys/socket.h (to avoid copying all the headers to netinet/*) means that including linux/in.h requires including sys/socket.h beforehand, otherwise you get errors.\n\nI could use more hackery like http://cs/android/bionic/libc/include/netinet/tcp.h?l\u003d35-37\u0026rcl\u003d8be5321f1abd7e1b672dd4edc0ca79b81d5c3888 to make netinet/in.h include linux/in.h while redefining __kernel_sockaddr_storage to sockaddr_storage, but that hack seems dangerous if linux/in.h was included first, triggering its #ifdef guard.",
