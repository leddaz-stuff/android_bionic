      "message": "it might potentially upset formatting code or signed/unsigned comparisons, but checkbuild succeeds.\n\ni think we want to change our blksize_t and blkcnt_t to be signed though.\n\nand if we look at the wider issue of fixing all these struct stats, though, we\u0027re in a similar situation for st_blksize as for st_nlink --- other architectures think that 32 bits are more than enough for your block size.\n\ni can undo these two for now and come back to them later if you prefer?",
