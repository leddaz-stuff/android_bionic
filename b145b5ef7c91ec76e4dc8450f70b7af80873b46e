      "message": "Simply deleting the call to _using_default_dns without first putting proper routing in place may break apps that use startUsingNetworkFeature - they\u0027ll think they are on a secondary network and expect both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups to happen, but instead they\u0027ll just make lookups for the IP address families that the default interface has (because of our implementation of AI_ADDRCONFIG).\n\nOnce routing is in place this will start to work again, but is there something we can do about it in the meantime? Maybe have netd pass down a special \"unknown\" netid value that always causes both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups to happen?",

      "message": "Three comments:\n1. Ironically _using_default_dns() will always return true at present because nobody passes a non-NULL iface down.  So in this regard removing _using_default_dns() is the correct thing to do, but this makes adding the netid parameter to _have_ipv[46]() incorrect as you note.\n2. Your _using_default_dns() suggestion unfortunately won\u0027t work because netid\u0027s set to NETID_UNSET will have been converted to the default netid back in netd, see:\n https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/87542/1/DnsProxyListener.cpp@211\n3. The manual page says configured addresses are checked on the \"local system\" while RFC2553 says configured source addresses on the \"node\" are checked.  We\u0027re kind of in a grey area because we\u0027re trying to do interface/netid-specific lookup.\n\nMy suggestion:\nWe get rid of _using_default_dns() because it didn\u0027t do anything in the past and we put _have_ipv[46]() back to the way they were (without netid param) so as not to mess with the old working behavior.\nWDYT?",
