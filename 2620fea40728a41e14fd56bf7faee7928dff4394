      "message": "+cferris: what do you think of my use of an overload here --- stupid or clever?\n\nit\u0027s annoying you can\u0027t turn a std::regex back into its pattern. and makes me wonder whether we should _only_ have the regex form of Run() but have it take a `const char*` instead. (though obviously that means rewriting all the existing ExecTestHelper tests to escape their last argument, so if that\u0027s the consensus then i\u0027ll volunteer myself to fix that [but let smoreland get his change in in the meantime].)",
