      "message": "Oh indeed, sorry about that, I forgot to mention that you would need the latest release. This is because the architecture used to allow SCTLR_EL1.{TCF,TCF0} to be cached in TLBs, which prevented the kernel from context switching TCF0 efficiently. The architecture was modified in September, and the release 11.9 of the fast model includes that change.",
