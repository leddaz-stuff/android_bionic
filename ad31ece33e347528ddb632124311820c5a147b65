      "message": "Yes, Please find bug id : https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/339332645.\nBackground of this is, We had GPU pagefaults on long test (mainly with monkey for 16 hours) on AMD x86_64 based platform. On further debugging we observed that, the pagefault was due to GPU accessing already freed buffer pointed by a file descriptor.\n\nMesa has a dependency on kcmp to check if 2 file descriptors are same. If same, mesa has a logic to handle gracefully of not freeing fd if still in use",
