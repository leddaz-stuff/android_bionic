      "message": "meh, this seems safe enough --- there are no intervening api levels anyway, so even if it were to go out via \"trunk stable\", there would be no way to refer to that /facepalm\n\nrewording it just makes it harder to read.\n\n(if you were going to change something, i\u0027d always include an api level, but that\u0027s not a regression given the \"Android 14\" above. personally i shy away from the \"marketing names\" [even though they\u0027re numbers right now] because they can and do change at short notice. i\u0027d worked on key lime pie for a year before i found out the same day as the general public that i\u0027d _actually_ been working on kitkat :-) )",
