      "message": "I would prefer if the code was more explicit about its assumptions. For example, this function will crash with a SIGBUS if magic32 is not 32-bit aligned.\n\nIn this specific case, the first page of the ELF header is copied to __header, so this is not a problem, but I would strongly prefer that this is made explicit in the function.\n\nSo, please choose either one of these:\n\n1/ Add a simple test for 32-bit alignment for magic32, and return -1 if this is not the case (i.e. make the function generic)\n\nor\n\n2/ Modify the function to check __header directly, and rename it to show that it is not a generic function (plus document the pre-requisite).",
