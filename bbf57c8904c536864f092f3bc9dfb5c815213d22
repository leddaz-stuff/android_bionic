      "message": "for readability. this originally said \"mov x2, x0\", but (a) that was less readable and (b) meant we couldn\u0027t move _JB_SIGMASK around without rewriting the code. this way it stays correct.\n\nunless it\u0027s the *4 rather than *8 that you\u0027re complaining about, in which case, yes, i wholly agree. i much prefer the x86-64 code. afaics the only reason this code works in uint32s rather than uint64s is to save 8 bytes by packing the magic and non-RT sigmask together. but that\u0027s a bug. i\u0027d like to come back and re-do this. i think (though i reserve the right to change my mind when i\u0027ve actually seen it) that i\u0027d prefer to have a constant for each slot too, rather than the two _BASE constants. but not in this change.",
