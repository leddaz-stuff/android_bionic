      "message": "\u003e is it even possible to get that far through pthread_exit() with a clobbered x18?\n\nYes, it was the intent of the design that pthread_exit() would not depend on x18 being unclobbered. Otherwise, every multi-threaded NDK application that was built before clang started reserving x18 would probably crash or misbehave at thread exit. So I\u0027m quite sure that we can\u0027t do this on arm64.",
