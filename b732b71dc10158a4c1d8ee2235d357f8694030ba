      "message": "the trouble is that this part of the test was meant to show one of the select/pselect differences: that one updates the timeout and the other doesn\u0027t. clearly the current test isn\u0027t good, but i\u0027d rather fix it than lose that aspect.\n\ni guess we need a timer that writes to a pipe after a certain interval?\n\nor simpler might be something like \"turn tv into a double timeout_s, and assert that it\u0027s \u003d\u003d 1s or less\"?",
