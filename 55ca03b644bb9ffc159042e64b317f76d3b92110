      "message": "This explanation doesn\u0027t make sense here as this is only a single instruction after \"it\", unless for some reason it is converting it to add a \"false\" instruction immediately afterwards to correspond to the \"bne\", but honestly that seems crazy. Is this really the error message produced? PC-relative ldr/str is also deprecated in an \"it\" block, so perhaps that is what is happening here (although I don\u0027t see how it would happen, but these inline assembly constraints are also very complex).",
