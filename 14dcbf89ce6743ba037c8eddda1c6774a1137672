      "message": "Hi :) sorry for the late comment, just digging around the various values of the \"next\" API level. Is there a reason this value isn\u0027t shared with Java (which uses 10000)? http://cs/android/frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Build.java?l\u003d1048\u0026rcl\u003d3f0c50b2f4cca35d1869d72bc689e170211fb7aa",

      "message": "Yeah, they\u0027re a bit different between the two domains. Next-release and unknown-future-release are different for the NDK. Once S branches, we need to be able to differentiate between S and T. For Java, a branch that contains non-final S APIs has no way of differentiating non-final T APIs.\n\nBut we can\u0027t make this be 10000 until S branches either, because 10000 also has different meaning than it does in Java. For native code it generally means *not* NDK.\n\nThe docs are better at HEAD: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:bionic/libc/include/android/api-level.h;l\u003d60;drc\u003dd8f46916b6d1b26bc351a631ca5a6fe099e4b029",
