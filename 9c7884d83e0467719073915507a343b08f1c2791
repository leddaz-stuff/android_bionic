If this is not present in maps doesn\u0027t it mean that relro call failed and this is why it ended up not being mmaped?\n\nSeems like this is not a root cause even if this was triggered by switching to another linker.",

      "message": "The root problem is that GNU strip replaced the GNU_RELRO segment header generated by lld. The impact is that some sections won\u0027t be marked as read-only, won\u0027t be mapped to the special temp file expected here, and have potential security risk. Normal programs not writing to the read-only sections would work fine and the page sharing still works.\nI thought that it would take a long time to fix lld bug, so this CL was proposed to relax the test.\nNow, I have a simpler plan to fix/replace GNU strip, so this test does not need to be changed.",
