      "message": "Sorry that it\u0027s taken me a few days to get back to you on this - but I\u0027m not convinced this should affect MTE, for a couple of reasons:\n 1. AFAICT, the fact that this disables MTE is the reason that stops us from being able to turn heap initialization back on afterwards. Given that the thread-only disable_mem_init() function only sets a thread-local variable, I assumed it would be a good use case where a developer would have a hot malloc that they don\u0027t want to eat the cost of MemInit on, and they could just flip it off/on again cheaply.\n 2. At least to me \"disabling heap memory initialization\" seems unrelated to MTE, and I\u0027d be surprised as a user for this side effect to happen. But, this could be solved with a slight rename to \"android_disable_heap_mitigations()\" or something.",
