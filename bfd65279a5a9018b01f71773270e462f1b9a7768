      "message": "I was hoping for a statement about guarantees that are or are not provided.  What can you conclude if you get the same or a different number back?  My impression is very little.  If you see an updated serial number then you will see the corresponding update or perhaps a later one?\n\nI think the prediction you\u0027re talking about here is in a sense heuristic; the updating thread could have done everything but update the serial number, and be suspended in that state.  Thus this is really only a hint?  If so, it would be nice to say that.\n\nI\u0027m pursuing this because it impacts the required memory ordering, I think.",
