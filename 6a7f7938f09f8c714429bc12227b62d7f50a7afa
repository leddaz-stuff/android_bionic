      "message": "Indeed this looks scary and a bit of maintenance issue. Will a missing annotation be detected in a non-MTE build? Likely not.\n\nYou probably put a lot of thought into it already, but just to make sure... What if we disabled mte-globals for linker? Alternatively, is it possible to move linker got setup earlier to limit the number of special globals?\n\nNote that these annotation disable global tagging both in linker and libc.so. Ex. both copies of stdin/stdout vars are unprotected.",

      "message": "I actually meant \"scary\" in relation to the number of files in the diff, but yeah, it\u0027s hard to stay on top of the maintenance.\n\nIt *would* be detected in an MTE build that runs on a non-MTE device though! It\u0027s probably going to require a whole bunch of build system glue to run a simple main() binary with an MTE-globals instrumented libc/libdl/etc. Probably a bit more difficult to use the linker (rpath and such).\n\n\u003e What if we disabled mte-globals for linker\n\nThat\u0027s the current patch, but most of the attribute spam is for the linker itself. There\u0027s a few in libc for sure, but I reckon 85%+ are preemptive for the linker.\n\nDo you think I should remove all the non-linker-required ones (gonna take a bit to run through and filter them out)? Then maybe can work on the MTE-globals-on-non-MTE as a follow up (but don\u0027t want to block this patch on it).",

      "message": "ABI-compatible, yes. Nothing to do with performance.\n\nThese annotations are needed because we punt all globals to be referenced through the GOT. If a GV is address-taken or loaded/stored before relocations have run, the GOT entry is null, and a crash occurs.\n\nSo, we need to annotate (e.g. disable memtag instrumentation) all GVs that are used before relocations have run. We don\u0027t build the linker right now with MTE globals, so there\u0027s nothing to annotate there. But, libc is built with MTE globals, so all GVs that are used before relocations run (basically stuff that\u0027s shared with the linker) need to have MTE globals disabled.",
