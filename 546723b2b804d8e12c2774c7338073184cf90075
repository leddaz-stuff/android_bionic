      "message": "I suppose an alternate approach is to change the interface to the linker, e.g.:\n\n1. Add some way of querying, \"do you support LD_CONFIG_FILE\". Add an argument --has-ld-config-file, embed a magic string in the linker binary...\n\n2. Change the test to use LD_CONFIG_FILE unconditionally, and detect when the feature didn\u0027t work because it wasn\u0027t supported. (Add a linker warning?)\n\nThis is easier, though. It basically just reverts this CL:\n\nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/bionic/+/514418/\n\nI don\u0027t know for sure that this CL would fix b/189422994, but it would fix b/140324381. It seems plausible that it would also fix the new issue.\n",
