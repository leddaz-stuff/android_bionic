      "message": "...but here `nmemb` is the 2nd argument, and `size` is 3rd.\n\nThe C convention for `calloc` is to put `nmemb` before `size`, so the cpp file implementation seems to be the ordering we want.\n\nI realize this change was made many years ago, but a recent change to this line (https://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/bionic/+/2292945) triggered this issue my static analysis which looks for recently changed lines.\n\nI\u0027ve put up a follow-up CL to have the header file change to match the cpp file here: https://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/bionic/+/2380128",
