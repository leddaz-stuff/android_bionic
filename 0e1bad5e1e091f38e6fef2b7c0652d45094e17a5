      "message": "yeah, doesn\u0027t this break flockfile for the case where the caller has said they\u0027ll handle locking themselves? (unfortunately i guess we can\u0027t write a test for that because there\u0027s no way to query the lock state.)\n\nmaybe we need to find a way to move the \"if (!__sdidinit) __sinit();\" into the FLOCKFILE macro?\n\nor maybe better is if we just flip the sense of _stdio_handles_locking to _caller_handles_locking? then it\u0027s false by default, __sinit doesn\u0027t change anything, and we don\u0027t have mismatched lock/unlock?",
