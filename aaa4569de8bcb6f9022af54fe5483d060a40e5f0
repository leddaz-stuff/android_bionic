      "message": "This is finally passing locally. However, I\u0027m not sure how to land this patch as is.\n\nFirst, its unclear to me what to do about the need for many of the test changes, since they require an updated toolchain. In particular the use of `-mtls-dialect\u003ddesc`in the tests will be an issue, since older toolchains won\u0027t accept that flag. Second, it\u0027s pretty obvious that we can\u0027t just delete `tests/Android.mk`, but that won\u0027t build when `LLVM_NEXT\u003dtrue` is set (and is required to test this patch). Lastly, there is a lack of DWARF cfi directives for the vector spill and restore, and if we want to support that fully, then we\u0027ll need to set up a frame pointer and currate the CFI as if this was a frame w/ a VLA.",
