      "message": "IIRC, our prelinked libraries always have all their internal relocations removed (only the PLT ones are kept). This also means that they cannot be relocated to a different address, i.e. this is not a \"hint\" at all, unlike the technique used on Linux/GLibc.\n\nAnd the reason we did this was to reduce the size of the libraries significantly, and thus speedup their load-time by requiring less pages from the disk (in addition to avoiding any relocation fixups).",
