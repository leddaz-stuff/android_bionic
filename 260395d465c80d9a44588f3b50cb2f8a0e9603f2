      "message": "Oops. Had intended to make bionic_coverage :\u003d false for check-in. The idea is that this behaves exactly like this file\u0027s use_clang, but affects all of bionic, not just libc.\n\nThis was actually done to work around a separate issue that I think I\u0027ve now solved... so I can probably do away with that and just leave it in the files we care about. Will test after lunch.",
