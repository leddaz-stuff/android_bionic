      "message": "I suspected a bug as well at first. Then I compared the results of glibc and it seems that we have a perfect match with them (at least for the few examples I tested). So it looks like a \"consistent\" issue. I tested with different values and they all seem to have the same precision error (i.e. DBL_DIG - 1).\n\nI also debugged the function itself and nothing seemed obviously wrong to me...\n\nI\u0027m happy to actually leave this tests failing if you think it\u0027s better.\n\nThis is true for x86 and arm. I think for mips as well but I didn\u0027t tested a failure there, just the success.",
