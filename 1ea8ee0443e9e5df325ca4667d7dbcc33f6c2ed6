      "message": "I suspected a bug as well at first. Then I compared the results of glibc and it seems that we have a perfect match with them (at least for the few examples I tested). So it looks like a \"consistent\" issue. I tested with different values and they all seem to have the same precision error (i.e. DBL_DIG - 1).\n\nI also debugged the function itself and nothing seemed obviously wrong to me...\n\nI\u0027m happy to actually leave this tests failing if you think it\u0027s better.\n\nThis is true for x86 and arm. I think for mips as well but I didn\u0027t tested a failure there, just the success.",

      "message": "hmm. does this mean we just picked a bad value with 123.456; one that isn\u0027t exactly representable? can we sidestep this whole thing by finding a \"better\" test value? all the modf family should be exact in the sense of returning the mantissa, right? so this is a case where the closest representable mantissa to the one we asked for is different (except for ld128)?\n\ni guess the #ifery in modfl is because glibc uses ld80, and that\u0027s good enough too?",
