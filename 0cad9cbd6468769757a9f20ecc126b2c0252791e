It is linking against the vendor variant of libc, which is stubs built from `out/soong/.intermediates/bionic/libc/libc/android_vendor_arm64_armv8-a_cortex-a53_shared/gen/stub.map`.  That file doesn\u0027t mention `strerrorname_np`, but the non-vendor stubs do.  The vendor stubs are built with `--api 202504`, which seems to come from the `BOARD_API_LEVEL` value.",
