Since the beginning of Treble, vendors do not build against NDK/SDK, but we implicitly extended the meaning of API levels to version something that is not NDK/SDK and became to have its own release schedule with trunk stable; we think this was a big mistake.  \n\nTherefore, YYYYMM (ex: 202404) is supposed to be a new version scheme (that is completely independent from the existing API level) that vendors use to identify the set of APIs available for them. VSR (vendor software requirement) is already written in terms of YYYYMM.",
