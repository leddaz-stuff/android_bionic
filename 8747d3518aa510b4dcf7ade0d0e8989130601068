      "message": "The stack pointer needs to be aligned to 16-bytes before the entry point is called. I don\u0027t think this code is doing that?\n\nOn arm32, the stack pointer should be 16-byte aligned.\n\nOn x86-32, I think the stack pointer is 16-byte aligned prior to the call instruction that calls the entry point. If we use a jump, then it would be 12-mod-16 aligned instead.\n\nAlso, I think we want CFI annotations indicating what\u0027s going on with the stack? Maybe something like BIONIC_STOP_UNWIND if we don\u0027t care about unwinding beyond this point. (We probably could unwind if we wanted to, though. Maybe that would be useful?)",
