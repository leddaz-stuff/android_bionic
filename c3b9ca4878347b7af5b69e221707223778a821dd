      "message": "Hi enh, thanks for the reviews.\n\nI took a stab at making this a gen rule and after checking with the soong folks seems there isn\u0027t anyway to do this in a genrule since it runs in a sandbox.\n\nThe artifacts here are not really expected to change often (or at all, unless the tests change). The script serves as a documentation.\n\nI couldn\u0027t find other tests that execute the elf reader path, so maybe it\u0027s worth checking in the prebuilts. WDYT?",
