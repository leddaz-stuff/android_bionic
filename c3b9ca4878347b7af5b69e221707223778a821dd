      "message": "Hi enh, thanks for the reviews.\n\nI took a stab at making this a gen rule and after checking with the soong folks seems there isn\u0027t anyway to do this in a genrule since it runs in a sandbox.\n\nThe artifacts here are not really expected to change often (or at all, unless the tests change). The script serves as a documentation.\n\nI couldn\u0027t find other tests that execute the elf reader path, so maybe it\u0027s worth checking in the prebuilts. WDYT?",

You don\u0027t need to check in copies of these libraries at all, just build them as part of the same build that builds the test.  I don\u0027t think you even need a genrule here, just use `data_libs` to depend on the  test libraries from the test.",
