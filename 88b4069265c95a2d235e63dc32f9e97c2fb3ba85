      "message": "this is the bit i don\u0027t like about this change, but the alternative isn\u0027t a whole lot better --- if i make the TLS slot a pointer to a struct dlerror_state_t or whatever, then i need something in pthread.c to clean that up on thread exit. so i\u0027m not sure that\u0027s actually preferable. the pthread implementation loses the dlerror _data_ but gains some dlerror _code_, which seems arguably worse.",
