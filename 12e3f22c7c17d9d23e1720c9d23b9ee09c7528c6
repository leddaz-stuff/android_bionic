      "message": "No, this is a different behavior than the extra file was. The extra file was for enabling coverage for _all_ of bionic because it looked like it was required for a successful build. This is just a flag to enable it for libm (and similarly for libc). The flag can be set here for local builds, and is overridden in my cron job with mm bionic_coverage\u003dtrue. Could have been libm_coverage/libc_coverage, but it doesn\u0027t make much difference.",
