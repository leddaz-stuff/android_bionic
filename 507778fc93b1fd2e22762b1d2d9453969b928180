(although arguably it\u0027s a completely new thing which is \"we do know what this is [and in this case, that\u0027s `_Nullable`] but clang doesn\u0027t understand common patterns for making use of this safe, so it would be a bad idea for us to actually specify this\" :-( )\n\n+danalbert for thoughts, including whether we should have a new __BIONIC_ macro to explain this (though i\u0027m struggling to think of a name). currently we don\u0027t have any direct use of unspecified, just the \"complicated\" macro.\n\n(like i said, this does kind of worry me about annotating struct fields in general. and most of our existing struct field annotations -- though they didn\u0027t cause build problems -- were a bit questionable to start with. so i guess one option is `__BIONIC_POINTER_IN_STRUCT` which doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s making any claim about anything, but can have a comment in \u003csys/cdefs.h\u003e explaining why we\u0027re opting out of annotating these for now.)",
