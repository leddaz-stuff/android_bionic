      "message": "I did this as a patchset since most of the code is yours.\n\nI changed a couple of things, I did a do not optimize around the actual calls since it seemed to optimize away the _tolower call on device with the sum method. I also fixed RandonNonAscii since the size of the vector was always zero, so I made the loop hard-coded to 128 when generating non-ascii characters.\n\nWhen running it, I\u0027m still worried that something is getting optimized away, since the wctype with ascii ones seem too fast. All of the other numbers feel correct though.",
