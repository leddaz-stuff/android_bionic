      "message": "i was curious about the background to this, and it looks like we didn\u0027t really have a good reason:\n```\nThe linker currently requires an absolute path. This restriction could be\nloosened, but it didn\u0027t seem important? If it allowed non-absolute paths,\nwe\u0027d need to decide how to handle:\n- foo/bar (relative to CWD?)\n- foo (search PATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or also relative to CWD?)\n- foo.zip!/bar (normalize_path() requires an absolute path)\n```\nso maybe we should just fix that? (for which my suggestion would be \"let\u0027s do the realpath thing, but do it _inside_ load_executable()\"?)\n\n+rprichard",
