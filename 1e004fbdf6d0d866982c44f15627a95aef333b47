      "message": "\u003e what libc are you building against? glibc?\n\nBear with me, hacking along without really knowing what I am doing and guidance is appreciated :) \n\nI am trying to update Crosvm (external/crosvm) for Cuttlefish with the merge in the attached topic (see aosp/1752440). The merge pulls in crrev.com/c/2688439 which adds `#include \u003clinux/input-event-codes.h\u003e` to external/crosvm/gpu_display/src/display_wl.c . Crosvm is built for both on device and on host. So, IIUC, it would be bionic\u0027s libc for on device and glibc for on host?",
