      "message": "AFAIK, Bionic arm* does implement variant 1, while x86* implements variant 2.\n\nFor simplicity and consistency with arm, the x86* implementation does place DSO TLS memory after the TCB rather than before it, but that shouldn\u0027t matter, because the R_GENERIC_TLS_TPREL relocations can handle positive and negative offsets equally well. (On x86, the executable\u0027s TLS segment and the DSO static TLS segments aren\u0027t contiguous -- there is a TCB in the middle, but that should be OK? This API returns the entire static TLS block for each thread.)\n\nAFAICT, the code before this CL is returning the right bounds.",
