      "message": "It\u0027s arbitrary and I didn\u0027t think about the most likely case. I will reverse the order as a follow-up.\n\nI\u0027m still half expecting to remove the time zone updates via APK feature entirely in the next release but I\u0027ll do that as a big topic when I make the final decision.\n\nFYI - even having the tzdata / tzlookup.xml files in com.android.runtime at all is unnecessary if we assume that the time zone module is always present (which eventually we will) because it includes complete copies. ICU is a slightly different matter because it ships an overlay file only. Still, I\u0027m covering as many bases as I can for the near term, especially while space is being made for the runtime APEX file on all our reference devices.",
