I hope the results won\u0027t be different between the two implementations, though if they are... that gives us more reason not to use this.\n\nThe surprising thing that I see is \u0027ab\u0027 and \u0027ab*\u0027 match \u0027ab/cd\u0027, but \u0027ab/\u0027 and \u0027ab?\u0027 do not.  That may be hard enough to explain to convince me that using this is a bad idea.",
