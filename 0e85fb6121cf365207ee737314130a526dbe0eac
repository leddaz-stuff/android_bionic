They don\u0027t provide a more detailed rationale but I think it\u0027s similar to the other places where sigmask is not the last (\"Allow for uc_sigmask growth. Glibc uses a 1024-bit sigset_t.\").\n\nI think we can explicitly pad this as well to ensure a consistent abi.\n\n| is glibc\u0027s sigset_t not insanely large on mips?\n\nGlibc also has an include file for the Generic/BSD version of sigset_t (unsigned long int) but it doesn\u0027t seem to be used. I couldn\u0027t find my way around their makefiles yet to be really sure which one gets used on mips.",
