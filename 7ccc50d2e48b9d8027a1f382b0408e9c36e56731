      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t say statically linked, since the symbols(etc) aren\u0027t shared between the linker and executable. But it\u0027s effectively merged, yes. \n\nThere are separate load segments for the linker and executable (though I\u0027ve seen gold combine the load segments in some cases). The linker script generated by the soong side of this change ensures that the load segments from the runtime linker (which are embedded as sections) are placed at an offset + their original vaddr, then lets the rest of the executable\u0027s sections to be placed normally. Or as normal as I could get it, since gold only partially supports linker scripts.",
