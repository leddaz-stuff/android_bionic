I added a script internally to compute the offsets (pthread_translation_regen.py) but I suspect it could be done in the C++ source file too. I remember experimenting with that approach but I don\u0027t remember if the error output was good enough.\n",

      "message": "Sorry, I didn\u0027t read closely. I think this is good enough.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s still clumsy if I have multiple WIP changes at once that alter one of these structures. Building and running the test is also a little slow. In an alternative approach, we could just list the field sizes and alignments, so each edit to this test would be small, but I suppose that\u0027d be hazardous, because someone would be tempted to use sizeof or alignof to specify a field location, defeating the point of the test.\n\nSo, I think I\u0027m OK with this change.",
