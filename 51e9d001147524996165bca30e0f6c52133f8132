      "message": "Agree with you, but for this case, I think it is actually not going to build build this file directly, it writing build file due to it will need to pack the file with test-suite packages and push it by TF.\n\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/h/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:platform_testing/scripts/perf-setup/tests/configs/perf-setup.xml;l\u003d23?q\u003dperf-setup%20file:xml\u0026sq\u003dgit:android%2F%2F%2Fmain@main\n\nAnd the final path will be out/target/product/vsoc_x86_64/testcases/perf-setup/x86_64/perf-setup.sh, the reason why I choose the obj folder is that the path is fixed, but if using the final testcase folder it will change the path by the arch of the lunch target.",
