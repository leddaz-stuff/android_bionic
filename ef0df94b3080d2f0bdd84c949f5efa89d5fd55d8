(the others weren\u0027t really right either.)\n\nthe right place for this is in libc/Android.mk. look for where we currently add in ndk_cruft.cpp; there\u0027s already other LP32 cruft.\n\nthese files are supposed to be just for architecture-specific stuff. it\u0027s a bug that we don\u0027t have a better solution for dealing with the optimized string libraries (and the fact that no one has a complete set).",
