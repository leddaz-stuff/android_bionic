      "message": "yeah, but _other_ stuff in toybox (and bionic) relies on /proc. (there\u0027s a lot of stuff that\u0027s implemented via /proc/self/fd, for example.)\n\nmy question is --- \"is toolbox modprobe the only binary you ever need to be able to run before /proc is mounted?\". if so (and you\u0027ve already tested toolbox modprobe and it\u0027s fine with just this), i think this change probably makes sense. if not, i don\u0027t think we should try to go down the route of working around _every_ use of /proc in bionic and/or toybox, and should just make sure you mount /proc nice and early instead...",
