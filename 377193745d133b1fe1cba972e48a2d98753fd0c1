      "message": "From perfetto side: LGTM, there\u0027s still a window of vulnerability before a process gets to libc_init, but we\u0027re working around that (on the signalling side) for dynamically-linked processes already.\n\nFor posterity, there was an attempt to add these SIG_IGNs earlier at the linker stage (aosp/1261318), but that didn\u0027t land due to concerns with complicating the linker code for a still-racy solution.\n\nThere was also an attempt (aosp/1261226) to wrap execve to make sure that the signals stay blocked until it is safe. Which also didn\u0027t land due to complexity concerns. Going forward, we\u0027re looking at ways to reduce/remove reliance on signals for profiling in the first place.\n\nThere\u0027s no good reason we haven\u0027t landed a patch like this ages ago.",
