      "message": "i don\u0027t think the new size check will ever reasonably fire on a FORTIFY\u0027ed fgets call. given `__check_buffer_access` has a sig of `void(const char*, const char*, size_t, size_t)`, `supplied_size` will be implicitly converted into a `size_t` w/ sign extension. on 32-bit, the buffer would have to be \u003e 1/2 our addr space. on 64, gooooood luck. :)\n\ndunno how much we care about doing slightly worse with this particular diagnostic, though. if we care, only checking the access if `supplied_size` is positive sgtm",
