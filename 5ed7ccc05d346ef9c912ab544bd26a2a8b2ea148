      "message": "yeah, the \"\u003cinvalid\u003e\" was just something we made up anyway ... it could equally well have been nullptr and starting the loop at 1. or (as i went with here) removing the unused element that would correspond to 0 were 0 a valid `wctype_t` and adding 1 to get the `wctype_t` value from the array index.\n\n(but, no, we also have no reason to believe wctype() has any non-test callers.)",
