      "message": "It\u0027s not a crash, but other pthread functions just start returning invalid values or deadlocking. I found a bug in glibc referencing some strange behavior after calling clone and a fix put in a while ago. I suspect when we move to gcc 4.8 for host this will just start working as intended (assuming we get a new version of glibc too). I\u0027ll follow-up to see if I can try out a new glibc and if the problem goes away. I also suspect the other stdio change will be fixed with a newer glibc.\n\nI did try to change the parameters, seeing if maybe we allocated a too small stack or something else, but no love. I spent time with the man page and it looks like we\u0027re calling it correctly.",
