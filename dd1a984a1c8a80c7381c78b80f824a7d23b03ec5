      "message": "The cortexa9 implementation we are using assumes ARM_NEON. We are trying to minimize the number of #ifdef XXX because it makes the code really difficult to follow. It would be better to break this into two implementations, one with neon support and one without. I know that it can lead to some small issues with maintenance, but this code really doesn\u0027t change that often and trying to wade through all of the ifdefs is a pain.",
