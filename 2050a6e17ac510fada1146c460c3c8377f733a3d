      "message": "I am only adding header_libs here.  This means both core variant (/system/lib/libc.so) and the vendor variant (not sure where does it go) are using the same header.  In the past, the vendor variant uses the one generated by versioner.  If we want the old behavior, we can add:\n\n    target: {\n        vendor: {\n            exclude_header_libs: [\"libc_headers\"],\n            shared_libs: [\"libc\"],\n        },\n    },\n\nHowever, I feel that it is a little confusing to to so.",
