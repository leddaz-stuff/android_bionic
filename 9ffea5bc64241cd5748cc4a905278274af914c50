      "message": "I don\u0027t think this actually works. The problem is that the entire page_info struct needs to be a multiple of 16-bytes (or 8-bytes), since you then use the following space to refer to the rest of the page itself. Perhaps it would be better to end this struct with an aligned void* that actually means the rest of the page. You could then use offsetof to drive size calculations, etc.",

      "message": "I was wondering about that too and looked at the attribute definition. Supposedly sizeof returns multiples of alignment, so it should be fine:\n\n\"When applied to a class type, the result is the size of an object of that class plus any additional padding required to place such object in an array.\"\n\nPersonally I\u0027d suggest a static_assert, though. :-)",
