      "message": "I don\u0027t think this actually works. The problem is that the entire page_info struct needs to be a multiple of 16-bytes (or 8-bytes), since you then use the following space to refer to the rest of the page itself. Perhaps it would be better to end this struct with an aligned void* that actually means the rest of the page. You could then use offsetof to drive size calculations, etc.",
