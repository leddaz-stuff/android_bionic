(and shouldn\u0027t be more costly unless it\u0027s on --- we already have the \"are we logging symbol resolution?\" flag, and this is just an \"okay, we are, but is this the symbol we care about?\" check _after_ that succeeds [in the vanishingly rare cases where it succeeds].)",

[http://b/309528372].\n\ni feel like one of the (many) problems with our LD_DEBUG is that we had too much in any given option, which made them _less_ useful. it got very \"all or nothing\", to the point where we basically started again here.",
