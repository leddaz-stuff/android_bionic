      "message": "no, the point of the `_mte` routines isn\u0027t that they _require_ mte hardware --- it\u0027s that they\u0027re _safe_ for mte-capable hardware (such as: they don\u0027t over-read). so we always need to use the mte version where it\u0027s available.\n\nthis is true of the dynamic side too --- MTE needs to trump SVE in the chained if statements.\n\nyou may have seen that i\u0027ve been removing the assembler from bionic this week and enabling the ASIMD routines too. hopefully those changes will all be in before the end of this week. i\u0027m out next week, but i\u0027ll look at SVE then. feel free to rebase and fix this cl yourself (that way you\u0027ll be able to keep the credit in the git history!) but if you don\u0027t care about the \"fame\" and just want it done, feel free to leave it to me :-)",

      "message": "oh, yeah, i\u0027d forgotten about the build system stuff. yeah, that doesn\u0027t seem particularly useful to me? we\u0027d certainly prefer that people use ifuncs or whatever rather than `target: { arch: {` clauses. (and if you really want to have an impact, reverting the \"pessimization\" done a few years back for the generic system image stuff that means that we don\u0027t take the specific arch variant into account when building all the platform code would be much higher on the list. i\u0027m hoping to get someone to look at that at some point, but there\u0027s no-one doing it right now [nor a clear picture of what exactly needs to be undone, so working that out would be a useful contribution too].)",
