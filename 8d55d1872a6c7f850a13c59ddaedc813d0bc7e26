      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should ignore this tag. If it is present then the dynamic loader would be required to sign any .got.plt entries with the IA key. If we don\u0027t want to support this behavior then we should probably report an error if we see it.\n\nUnfortunately binutils 2.33 inserts this tag by default which can occur when building the vDSO for the Linux kernel following the instructions here:\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:device/generic/goldfish/fvpbase/README.md;l\u003d105\nAs a result I have been seeing these warnings in FVP for a while.\n\nThe vDSO does not contain PLT entries so there turns out not to be a compatibility problem at runtime.\n\nSince this problem is specific to the experimental MTE configuration of FVP, it would be easiest to conditionalize the error on ANDROID_EXPERIMENTAL_MTE.",

      "message": "I also realized that it is unfortunate that the IA key was chosen for pac-plt (this isn\u0027t in the ABI but is implied by e.g. the implementation in lld) because it is also being used by default for return address signing. This would preclude different IA keys from being used on different threads, or on zygote fork, because changing the IA key would result in all future IA authentications in PLT entries failing. A platform that wants to make use of pac-plt together with thread diversity for IA keys would need to select a different key, most likely IB, for return addresses.\n\nSince pac-plt provides little value on Android because we already have RELRO I think this means we will have to forbid pac-plt on Android and make the presence of this dynamic tag an error.",
