      "message": "This is going to need a bigger change.  Devices may be configured in any combination of (armv7-a-neon|armv8-a)x(cortex_a53|cortex_a57|denver|...)\n\nBoth the arch variant and cpu variant sections will apply.  So the cpu flags in cortex_a53 for example need to apply on top of either the armv7-a-neon or armv8-a arch flags.\n\nMaybe we should override TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT if TARGET_CPU_VARIANT is specified?  It seems like CPU variant cortex_a53 should imply arch variant armv8-a, even though every existing product specifies armv7-a-neon.",

      "message": "Cortex-a53/a57/a73, denvor, and kryo are all armv8-a, while Cortex-a7/a8/a9/a15 and krait are all armv7-a. IOW, TARGET_CPU_VARIANT does determine TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT (to some degree). NEON are usually (but not necessarily) included in almost all processors above these days, but it\u0027s outside the scope/purpose of this CL.\nThis block is here because the generic code (in arch-arm/generic/strlen.c) uses assembly instruction, ldreq, deprecated in armv8, which will cause warnings and error because of -Werror. So we won\u0027t even build for 32-bit armv8 if this is not fixed.\nThe same implementation from cortex_a73 is used below (line 846 - 862) since it builds cleanly for generic armv8 and a73 is going to be very a common/popular armv8 core going forward.",
