      "message": "This is going to need a bigger change.  Devices may be configured in any combination of (armv7-a-neon|armv8-a)x(cortex_a53|cortex_a57|denver|...)\n\nBoth the arch variant and cpu variant sections will apply.  So the cpu flags in cortex_a53 for example need to apply on top of either the armv7-a-neon or armv8-a arch flags.\n\nMaybe we should override TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT if TARGET_CPU_VARIANT is specified?  It seems like CPU variant cortex_a53 should imply arch variant armv8-a, even though every existing product specifies armv7-a-neon.",
