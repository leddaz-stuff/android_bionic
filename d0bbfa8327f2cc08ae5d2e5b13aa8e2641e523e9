      "message": "yeah, the alternative fix was indeed a PITA. but i realized too late that we probably need this if we want to (a) ensure _all_ the functions in this file access the global state under a lock and (b) keep res_init() working.\n\n(_do_ we actually want property (a)? if so, will we need a recursive lock? since none of this lossage is a regression in S, and no-one\u0027s noticed any of these issues in the last decade, we might want to wait for T before submitting this, so we have a full year to notice any fallout... assuming we don\u0027t think it matters that we\u0027ve made res_init() a no-op in S, which might be a regression for someone?)",

      "message": "\u003e _do_ we actually want property (a)?\nSpeaking of the functionalities, (a) is required, because the race might happen between res_{query, search}.\nHowever, I think it probably doesn\u0027t matter. And it would be better to encourage the callers stop using them.\nGiven that res_{init,query,search} are networking relevant APIs but has no multi-network ability, I doubt if there are real users.\n\nActually, it\u0027s pretty hard for users(if any) to use the APIs, because some other required APIs(e.g. _resolv_set_nameservers_for_net) are not put at public header file, also the relevant structures have\u0027n been exported.",
