Some of the defines are renaming ns_* functions that aren\u0027t in the map file (ns_samedomain), and some of them rename functions that aren\u0027t defined at all (ns_verify). Maybe we updated the code and didn\u0027t update our declarations to match.\n\nMaybe we rename functions we aren\u0027t declaring/exporting, for consistency?",
