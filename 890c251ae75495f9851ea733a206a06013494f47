      "message": "I\u0027d change this to do the join before the loop. The idea is just to force some allocations that would cause arenas to be created.\n\nOnce the arenas are created, the mallinfo call should take the same amount of time whether there are a lot of live allocations or not. There is a caveat, that if you are trying to do a mallinfo while allocations are occurring, it will change the call time of mallinfo. I don\u0027t know if this is something you care about though.",

      "message": "It seemed to me that this is a bit more robust against changes in malloc internals, since there is no opportunity to notice that the arenas are empty and no longer needed.\n\nAre you concerned that the other threads may still be starting up during the loop? I guess that is a concern, though I would expect the effect to be minor. It would be easy enough to explicitly wait for the allocations to complete before entering the loop. Would that resolve your concern?",

      "message": "Yes, making sure everything is allocated before the loop would make me feel better. I was mostly worried that there would be allocations occuring at the same time as the mallinfo call, and that will probably change the timing significantly.",
