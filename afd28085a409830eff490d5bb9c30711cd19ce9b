      "message": "the change is fine, but the commit message is misleading. i think something like \"getentropy() was originally in \u003csys/random.h\u003e and remains there on macOS/iOS, but glibc later duplicated it in \u003cunistd.h\u003e too (musl _only_ has it in \u003cunistd.h\u003e, presumably because POSIX [link] adds it there)\" is closer. (also, although no-one cares about fuchsia, \"macOS is an outlier\" is pretty misleading in this context --- most _app_ developers want source compatibility with iOS, not glibc! _platform_ developers, of course, tend to hold the opposite preference. \"be source compatible with both where possible, for that reason\" is our default policy.)\n\nnote that man7 _used_ to say \u003csys/random.h\u003e but that was changed with a similarly misleading commit message with no rationale :-( at least they fixed\n```\n+In earlier versions of glibc this function was avaible under the\n+.BR \u003csys/random.h\u003e\n+header.\n```\nin the original commit to\n```\n.BR getentropy ()\nis also declared in\n.BR \u003csys/random.h\u003e .\n(No feature test macro need be defined to obtain the declaration from\nthat header file.)\n```\nnow!",
