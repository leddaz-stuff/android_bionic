      "message": "That was always a thought.  I think we got side tracked trying to find out if people would want to have the test data left over to debug a failing test and never moved forward with anything.  At least for this test, the test data is pretty useless, so this change is for-sure safe.  The TemporaryDir change is probably safe too.\n\nWe\u0027d need to make this handle subdirectories if we moved it to TemporaryDir too.",
