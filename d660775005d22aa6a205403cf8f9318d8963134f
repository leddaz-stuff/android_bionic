      "message": "Changing this to ASSERT_TRUE(fp !\u003d NULL) and comparing with the expansion of a similar line in stdio_test.cpp shows that the output is completely identical.\n\nAt this point I suspect the issue is because the macro is being used inside a standalone function, instead of a TEST(...) { ... } block.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u0027t seem correct either. E.g. plenty of Breakpad unit tests do call these macros in such functions without a problem. I\u0027m still puzzled.",
