      "message": "Afaik, part of the intention of the fixit is indeed to downgrade these messages.  The theory is that Error is reserved for necessarily user-visible issues (https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style#log-sparingly).  These access denied issues may be true user-visible issues, but are not necessarily the case, hence thinking that warning is more appropriate.\n\nMy additional rationale for why \u0027W\u0027 makes sense here is that the associated SELinux denial is also \u0027W\u0027 instead of \u0027E\u0027.",
