      "message": "what\u0027s your use case? i looked at these and decided that strerrordesc_np() is worse than what\u0027s already available, and strerrorname_np() -- while potentially useful -- isn\u0027t something i can actually think of a place where i\u0027d use it. plus it\u0027s not in our version of glibc, and isn\u0027t in musl, which we\u0027re switching to for host tools. so anyone who used strerrordesc_np() would have to use a more portable existing alternative, and anyone wanting strerrorname_np() would have to reimplement it anyway.\n\n(though if you know that musl *is* adding strerrorname_np(), it might be a bit more interesting... iOS would be even more convincing, because that would likely be a real portability issue app developers would hit sooner or later.)",
