(looks like it might be time to stop running this against glibc [because they changed llvm in a way that our modern llvm will require a newer glibc to pass], so it would be good to see where musl disagrees, since this is just supposed to be \"what posix promises\" and i wouldn\u0027t expect divergence between us and musl there?)\n\npirama: what was the bug again?",
