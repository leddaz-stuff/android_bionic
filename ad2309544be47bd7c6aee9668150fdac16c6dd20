      "message": "I think bionic should take ownership of the string. This is consistent with android_set_abort_message and harder to abuse. It may cause us to do one more heap memory allocation sometimes. But I expect a lot of time the string is actually dynamically generated with insufficient lifetime in the app, so the caller would have to do the same anyway.",
