      "message": "this test is really testing \"does _Unwind_ForcedUnwind call cleanup functions as it unwinds through them?\", and the answer is \"no\" for all but x86. even x86-64 doesn\u0027t work. this feels like it should be a libgcc test rather than a bionic one, so i\u0027ll remove this test in a later patch. (now that we have simpler tests for \"can we unwind through a signal frame?\".)",
