      "message": "I\u0027m thinking two things,\n1. If we want to measure entire release period, given that during each free, we may still call release-to-os. Different releasing strategy may affect the time spent in explicit calling M_PURGE, as a result, I\u0027m not sure if the number can tell it\u0027s good or bad when we see a number decreased.\n2. We may want to do more iterations of malloc/free then collect the numbers. The first round of consecutive malloc followed by consecutive free may fall into certain optimal cases. (We can discuss more details in the meeting)",
