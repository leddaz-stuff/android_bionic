      "message": "This is a style nit, but would it be better to put some of these checks at the top?\n\nFor example, move the heap_tagging_level check as is above the switch. Then modify the second if check to something like:\n\nif (tag_level \u003d\u003d M_HEAP_TAGGING_LEVEL_TBI \u0026\u0026 heap_tagging_level !\u003d M_HEAP_TAGGING_LEVEL_NONE ||\n    heap_tagging_level \u003d\u003d M_HEAP_TAGGING_LEVEL_TBI \u0026\u0026 tag_level !\u003d M_HEAP_TAGGING_LEVEL_NONE) {\n}\n\nThen the switch doesn\u0027t require a second if check and all error checking is happening before the switch. But this is your code so feel free to ignore this suggestion.",
