      "message": "This function is a bit confusing. Do you expect the properties to ever change over the lifetime of the process?\n\nRegardless, I think it would be better to do a single one time initialization, maybe using pthread_once, or doing it in some other static initialization.\n\nAlso, rather than return a character, it would be better to return either CLOCK_MONOTONIC or CLOCK_REALTIME. That way none of the callers need to check if the timestamp is \u0027m\u0027.\n\nIf you do this, you can just cache the clockid_t value instead of anything else.",
