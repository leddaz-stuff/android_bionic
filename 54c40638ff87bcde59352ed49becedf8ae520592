This code runs earlier and checks a PT_NOTE instead.\n\nI\u0027m guessing we aren\u0027t generally checking whether program headers extend past the end of the file.\n\nThe new error check seems fine to me. I suspect the value could overflow but I don\u0027t think the loader generally guards against that.",
