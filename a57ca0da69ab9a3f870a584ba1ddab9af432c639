      "message": "Static bionic tests started to segfault on MIPS. I saw that this piece of code gets executed before main() and crash. dlopen() does not crash if called after the application has initialized properly (e.g. if I convert have_dl from variable to C function). I was wondering is dlopen() expected to work if called before main() in static applications?",
