      "message": "this is incorrect. _DIR_avail simply holds the number of entries that were read in the buffer, this had nothing to do with the current position.\n\nTo implement this correctly, you need to add a member to the DIR state that indicates the offset/index of the current entry, and increment it on each readdir() call.\n\nThen have seekdir() perform the necessary number of readdir() operation to go to the same index.",
