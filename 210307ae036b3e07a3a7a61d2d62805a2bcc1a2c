(b/119274217)\n\nRoland, is the change in this file a must for you? I know that the dep_path change in the other file is a must, but I am not sure about this one. These paths are used only when the linker fails to find a matching linker namespace config from ld.config.txt.\n\nIf so, why don\u0027t you proceed only with the dep_path change to unblock other stuffs?",
