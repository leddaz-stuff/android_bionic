      "message": "it was mtk\u0027s benchmark results[1] that set me off on this cleanup :-)\n\nbut to the larger question ... \"i would want to go this way anyway\". mtk just wants the faster routines. i obviously don\u0027t _not_ want that, but i\u0027m actually more interested in getting out of the business of bionic having its own (unmaintained) forks of \"whatever arm said\".\n\n___\n1. TL;DR: the asimd code is quite a bit faster, but the sve code is only slightly faster than that. i\u0027ll enable sve anyway (after thanksgiving!) even though it\u0027s not a big improvement.",
