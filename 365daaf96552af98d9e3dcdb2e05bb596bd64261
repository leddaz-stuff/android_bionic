This is what heapprofd does already since S [1] and we realized too late we forgot to apply the same logic to stack sampling (go/perfetto-s-beta-retrospective has more historical background).\n\nSeems consistent from my viewpoint, but I understand you want an opinion from somebody from security. +jeffv\n\n[1] https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/perfetto/src/profiling/memory/client.cc;l\u003d173?q\u003dprctl%20f:profil",
