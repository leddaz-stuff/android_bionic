      "message": "i actually did change them both to be hardcoded but felt guilty hardcoding something that didn\u0027t need to. the reason __page_shift is hardcoded isn\u0027t backwards compatibility (PAGE_SIZE hasn\u0027t changed) --- it\u0027s because i\u0027ve removed PAGE_SHIFT. the other C libraries don\u0027t have it, and no one was using it. shipped binaries either have a hardcoded \"12\" already or -- depending on where they came from -- a reference to __page_shift.\n\nthat\u0027s assuming anyone actually has a binary that refers to the page shift at all. when it wasn\u0027t even used within bionic, despite the fact that the constant is actually needed in a couple of places, and it can be removed without anything in the platform needing to change, you have to suspect it\u0027s not widely used. (perhaps because it\u0027s not in glibc.)",
