      "message": "so you always get the SZ, but if you also get the COUNT then you know they\u0027re sequential? (though i don\u0027t understand you can really benefit much from that knowledge since you need to go through all the relocations anyway, no?) (plus doesn\u0027t that seem like weird naming? the fact that SZ tells you how many bytes to my mind implies that they\u0027re sequential. otherwise it\u0027s really weird to me that they\u0027d say \"there are 1234 bytes of relative relocations but they\u0027re scattered about\".)",

      "message": "naming is confusing... the difference between sz/ent and count is that the count is for *_RELATIVE relocation subset, it does not count the other kind (JUMP_SLOT for example). In theory we can do special cycle without checking the relocation type for next COUNT-1 once we encountered first _RELATIVE (?)...",
