      "message": "clang will complain about it if you give it -Wunreachable-code-return, which isn\u0027t under -Wall or -Wextra.\n\nSince this is a system header, those warnings will generally be suppressed by default. So my guess is that none of the -Werror projects that use this as a non-system header have -Wunreachable-code-return enabled.\n\nLooks like clang has:\n-Wunreachable-code-loop-increment\n-Wunreachable-code-break\n-Wunreachable-code-return\n\nThese can apparently get quite aggressive, which is why they\u0027re not currently on by default.\n\nI\u0027ll enable these globally for a build of some random lunch combo and see how many of each of those I hit.\n\n+srhines fyi",
