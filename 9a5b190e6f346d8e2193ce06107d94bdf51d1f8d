      "message": "That would be ideal, and why I mention this is temporary. The problem is that there are a few native servers that this would cause RSS increases. When enabling the decay timer everywhere, you can see an increase in just those few processes by more than 10MB or RSS per process.\n\nI do have a plan to enable this all of the time, but it\u0027s a little tricky and could potentially cause an increase in RSS any way, or even cause battery life problems.",
