(btw. is this guaranteed to be on a filesystem that supports large files ? Aren\u0027t some of our Sdcard file systems fat32 ?)\n\nPerhaps add a comment here (or somewhere where people will find it) explaining this ?",

      "message": "Yes, delegation will work in this case because our open is actually open64 and it will force O_LARGEFILE by default.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what you mean with \"Do we not want to support O_LARGEFILE?\"\n\nI don\u0027t think this is guaranteed to be on a file system that supports large files. In that case write will fail and I\u0027m not sure we can do anything about it.\n\nNote that although this works is not necessary the cleanest way since internally mkstemp make use of stat and lstat (without 64).",
