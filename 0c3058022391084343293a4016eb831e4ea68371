      "message": "this might be less unclear if you make it a size_t finished_child_count and ++ it. the break is confusing too. you should try to avoid break or continue in nested loops. try splitting the for loop out into a new function. (the other for loop before could usefully be a new function too. any time you have a function this long, blocks marked with comments are good candidates for splitting out --- you were able to describe it for a comment, so you can probably give it a name as a function.)",
