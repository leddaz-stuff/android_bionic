      "message": "I think this comes after the call to debug_write_malloc_leak_info() which has done purging in write_dump. So the reason we need this is that leak_info may also use a lot of memory. Then I may consider doing the purging in debug_dump_heap() and here, so we always purging at the place we know that we have finished releasing a bunch of memory.\n\nNo strong opinion here. Feel free to merge this approach :)",
