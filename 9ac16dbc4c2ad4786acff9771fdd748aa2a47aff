      "message": "Oops. Sorry that I missed this. I\u0027d like let you know that this is not related with Mainline at this moment (i.e. for T). This 64-bit APEX will be included in Microdroid which is a tiny Android that we run inside an on-device VM. The VM is already 64-bit only, so does this APEX. Microdroid (actually the virt APEX [1] where Microdroid is in) is not a Mainline module for T.\n\nWhen 64-bit-only becomes a reality even for Android, we could simply delete this variant and use the old one.\n\n[1] https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/Virtualization/apex/Android.bp;drc\u003d3ef78d9eab9d22c546406a1a8ba86265368b875b;l\u003d6",

      "message": "Not much to comment at this point. It\u0027s not something we mentioned really. Realistically if we ever need 64-bit only artifacts we\u0027ll produce a train to that effect (like we do for arm vs arm64 atm), put them in the same app bundle and let Play serving / bundletool do the right thing depending on the target device.\n\nSo it seems that we\u0027d need a product build for 64-bit only. This was hansson\u0027s and mine toy project when we joined CoreOS: b/72810053 but then the urgency wasn\u0027t there and we moved on to other things.\n\nThis said, I don\u0027t feel as strongly about creating a product build just for this change. I don\u0027t know much about Jiyong\u0027s intended use case.",
