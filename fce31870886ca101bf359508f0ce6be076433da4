      "message": "Honestly though, there has to be better names than \u0027pty\u0027 and \u0027tty\u0027.  Even after I redid all the terminal code in logwrap, I\u0027m still not clear on the acronyms.  I don\u0027t exactly have any suggestions though; I\u0027m just lamenting how unreadable this is unless you\u0027re already familiar with how terminals work.\n\n+danalbert@ since I remember hearing him talk about this in our meeting.",
