      "message": "Honestly though, there has to be better names than \u0027pty\u0027 and \u0027tty\u0027.  Even after I redid all the terminal code in logwrap, I\u0027m still not clear on the acronyms.  I don\u0027t exactly have any suggestions though; I\u0027m just lamenting how unreadable this is unless you\u0027re already familiar with how terminals work.\n\n+danalbert@ since I remember hearing him talk about this in our meeting.",

      "message": "given the number of suggestions i\u0027ve seen already, i\u0027m really not sure there are better names. i think the trouble here (and one reason why master/slave was never helpful) is that you do just need to learn this thing, and once you\u0027ve done that, \"pty end\" and \"tty end\" work.\n\nin a lot of contexts _callers_ might be better off using parent/child, but since that\u0027s not always the case, i think it\u0027s reasonable to not favor that for the API itself.\n\n(and as i say in the checkin comment, for the _code_ here i think pty/tty are almost optimal. but, yeah, i may have to come back for the API.)",
