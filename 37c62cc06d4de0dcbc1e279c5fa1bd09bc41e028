I\u0027m not sure if the change to __cxa_guard.cpp is necessary, in fact I\u0027m almost certain, but I\u0027ve left it in on the chance someone wants to download the patch and try out my set up.\n\nThis also requires a toolchain with aosp/3010633 reverted(e.g. with the toolchain\u0027s TLSDESC support back in place).",
