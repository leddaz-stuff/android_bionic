      "message": "falling through is less code, but -- assuming you\u0027re expecting to see __memcpy_chk in the backtrace -- the pattern that was already in use for memset (and some of the memcpys) does give us a better backtrace.\n\npersonally i don\u0027t think i\u0027d be too bothered by backtraces that appeared to show my code jumping straight to __memcpy_chk_fail, so maybe we want to save the branch in the non-failure case?\n\nfor now i\u0027m just going to make them all consistent and we can worry about that later. it\u0027s certainly easier to go in the direction of removal :-)",
