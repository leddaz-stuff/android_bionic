      "message": "This is for symbolizing pcs that were recorded previously. Before, if the code was unloaded or a map changes over time you could crash reading from what you think is a readable map. Now you won\u0027t no matter what. The pcs were recorded a long time ago, but the symbolization doesn\u0027t happen until some time later. That\u0027s why I added this caveat. If the map does disappear, all that happens now is that you have a raw pc with no other information.",
