      "message": "My impression is that Elliott does not like ldd being renamed to ldd.sh, so maybe a compromise we could make in order to unblock Bazel builds would be to move the ldd file to a subdirectory (/tools or /scripts or something) but keep the ldd sh_binary target here?\n\nFrom the Bazel perspective, ldd doesn\u0027t need to be renamed to ldd.sh, but the sh_binary name needs to be named ldd and there can\u0027t also be a file called ldd in the same directory",

      "message": "Well, I\u0027ve made that change (i.e. kept the ldd filename instead of ldd.sh, but moved it into a tools subdirectory to avoid a clash with the target name)\n\nSoong builds still seem to work\n\nAnd bp2build write; bazel build ... now works\n\nSo can we go with this compromise?
