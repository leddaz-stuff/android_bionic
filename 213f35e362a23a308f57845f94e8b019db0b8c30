Hopefully this will make it easier for someone to use Google and figure out what the hell is going on when this inevitably breaks.",

      "message": "is there a better name for this? aiui, it means \"built with -Bsymbolic\", which in turn means \"globals resolve within this library itself\". i\u0027m not sure how i\u0027d know that if i hadn\u0027t been following this thread. searching the web for \"symbolic relocations\" wasn\u0027t particularly helpful either. i feel like even built_with_Bsymbolic would be slightly less unhelpful. but maybe \"symbolic_relocations\" would be obvious if i knew more about dynamic linkers? (even then, i feel like it should be \"uses_symbolic_relocations\"...)",
