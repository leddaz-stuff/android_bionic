I mean before ret there will be an authentication for the return address that might not signed on entry because the function did not start at the beginning. Not an issue for leaf and asm functions.\n```\nfunc: \n   paciasp; # BTI landing pad too\n   push LR\n   ...\n   \u003c\u003c\u003c-- jump to the middle\n   ...\n   pop LR\n   autiasp  # here the SP shall be the same where LR is signed and pushed.\n   ret\n```\n\nNIT: For the test `readelf -n` (--notes) can be used, it just gives back content of the notes sections.",
