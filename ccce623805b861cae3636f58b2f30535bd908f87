I assume that\u0027s because the license parsing code doesn\u0027t understand Rust comments (I think the license in our file is already there).  Elliott, what should I do about this?",

      "message": "Looking into this a bit, it seems like generate_notice.py is having the problem I described above.  The issue is that it doesn\u0027t know where the license ends as we use Rust // comments instead of /* */ ones.  We could use the latter, but that is discouraged by Rust style guides (both upstream\u0027s and ours).\n\nElliott, would you prefer we use /* */ comments anyway?  Should we have the Python script recognize //! as an end marker (which denotes a module-level rustdoc comment string, so is a bit of a hack, but might work)?  Or should we add some recognizable string in a comment?",
