      "message": "POSIX says \"unsigned long\". so we can:\n\n1. go with POSIX, and have to add struct statvfs64, statvfs64, and fstatvfs64 later.\n\n2. go straight to 64-bit for statvfs but break expectations about these types. (in printf format strings, say.)\n\nthis patch takes option 1. it makes me slightly sad, but i figure it\u0027s only a small extra helping of turd on top of the big fat turd we already have.",
