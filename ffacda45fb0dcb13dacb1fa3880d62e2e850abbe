      "message": "yeah, i think we want to come back and:\n\n* switch everything to trap rather than abort().\n* switch the test to allocate more like eugenis said.\n* add eugenis\u0027 bug comment about the different ways a CFI failure can manifest.\n* change this to assume that we only see SIGILL/SIGTRAP (after i\u0027ve worked out which platforms -- if any -- give us SIGTRAP!).\n\nwe can go straight to the second option, but since we _do_ have CFI failure paths that call abort(), this change seemed strictly correct in its own right.\n\n(i\u0027ll upload another change for the second option since i think we want to do that too anyway, and gkaiser is able to easily repro right now...)",
