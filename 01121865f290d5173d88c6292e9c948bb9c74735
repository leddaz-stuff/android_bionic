Seems BDS gets better performance, security and reliability.\n\ni think the most useful distinction is probably \"macOS/iOS are BSD-based, desktop/server linux is GNU, and Android is stuck trying to make both app developers [who expect BSD interfaces/behaviors because of iOS] and os developers [who expect GNU interfaces/behaviors because of Linux/glibc] happy at the same time\".\n\n(the security thing you saw was probably referring specifically to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD... note that there are many BSDs, and they don\u0027t share nearly as much code as you\u0027d imagine if you\u0027re thinking in \"Linux distro\" terms.)",
