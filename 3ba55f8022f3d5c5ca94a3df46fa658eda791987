      "message": "i commented on an earlier patch: see L365 on the red side.\n\nthe tricky bit (which i only learned later) is that until we submit this patch we actually have *two* knobs that control BSD visibility (__BSD_VISIBLE and __USE_BSD), and they\u0027re not the same: some stuff was guarded by one, other stuff by the other.\n\nit might be an interesting experiment to try to remove this, but that\u0027s _more_ likely to break things than this. plus if you\u0027re building C++ you get _GNU_SOURCE for free, which already turned on both GNU and BSD stuff. so even if we did remove this, it would \"only\" affect C.",
