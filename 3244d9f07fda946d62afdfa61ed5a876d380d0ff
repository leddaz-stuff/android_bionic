We just need to write the function as:\n\nchar* realpath(const char* path, char* resolved) {\n  return __realpath_chk(path, resolved, __bos(resolved));\n}\n\nand do a runtime check instead of a compile time check. glibc has __realpath_chk(), and this would make bionic consistent with glibc. I think the runtime check is significantly more important than the compile time check.",
