/*
 * Error checking for close(2).
 *
 * Mishandling of file descriptor ownership is a common source of errors that
 * can be extremely difficult to diagnose. Mistakes like the following can
 * result in seemingly 'impossible' failures showing up on other threads that
 * happened to try to open a file descriptor between the buggy code's close and
 * fclose:
 *
 *     int print(int fd) {
 *         int rc;
 *         char buf[128];
 *         while ((rc = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
 *             printf("%.*s", rc);
 *         }
 *         close(fd);
 *     }
 *
 *     int bug() {
 *         FILE* f = fopen("foo", "r");
 *         print(fileno(f));
 *         fclose(f);
 *     }
 *
 * To make it easier to find this class of bugs, bionic provides a method to
 * require that file descriptors are closed by their owners. File descriptors
 * can be associated with tags with which they must be closed. This allows
 * objects that conceptually own an fd (FILE*, unique_fd, etc.) to use their
 * own address at the tag, to enforce that closure of the fd must come as a
 * result of their own destruction (fclose, ~unique_fd, etc.)
 *
 * By default, a file descriptor's tag is 0, and close(fd) is equivalent to
 * closing fd with the tag 0.
