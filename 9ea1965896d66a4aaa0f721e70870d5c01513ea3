      "message": "Taking this from the original commit, but this does seem wrong.  I think there are two possibilities here:\n\n1) We continue with the is_oem_id() checks and only source the passwd/group files from /vendor, since in a Treble world, all vendor (oem) info should be on /vendor.  We would not use /system/etc/{passwd,group} in this case.\n\n2) We continue with the is_oem_id() checks for vendor, but also check !is_oem_id() \u0026\u0026 !is_valid_app_id() and after having checked android_ids, check /system/etc/{passwd,group}.  We could even move to a future where the android_ids array is deprecated in favor of those files, but honestly, I don\u0027t see a huge gain there.",
