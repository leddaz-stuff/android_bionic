      "message": "I was trying to keep this code similar to the multi-use code we have in liblog to ease maintenance.\n\nQuick check makes the code more complicated as it would need to be tristate and introduce a magical non-conflicting CLOCK_UNDEFINED that denotes not set in order to preserve the logic hierarchy, then expand lines 525+526 and 536+537 followed by the check here to eliminate CLOCK_UNDEFINED. Seems like no gains at all?",
